                    <i>Learn the basics of freediving by uncovering your natural
                        freediving ability. Here you will be taught to dive down 12 to 20
                        meters, and learn techniques to hold your breath beyond a minute
                        and a half. Topics include the physics of freediving, introduction
                        to equalization and breathing, dive visualization and much more.
                        Course duration is typically 2-3 days.</i><br><br>
                    Discover the underwater world in the most natural way by holding your breath. The Wave 1 will take you through a fun and relaxed experience yet with a strong focus on make you a safe freediver. Everyone can access the Wave 1 course. You just need be healthy and able to swim 200 meters. By the end of this course, through passing pool, depth, safety and theory requirements, you will become a complete Wave 1 freediver.

In this course, you will get all the basis of freediving and will become an autonomous freediver able to explore the underwater world comfortably. You will learn how to practice freediving safely, what happens with your body when you hold your breath, how to dive more efficiently and how to handle freediving mentally– but also any other life situation. By the end of the course, you should be able to dive safely and comfortably between 12 and 20 meters — which is the depth limit for this course — experiencing both using fins or pulling on a rope to go down. You will also learn distance disciplines in the swimming pool, with and without fins, with a focus on technique and efficiency.
<br><br>
You will learn about the physics acting on your body, pressure, Boyle’s law, Archimedes principle and their applications int the water: You will also learn to check if you are properly weighted in the swimming pool and in open water and you will learn equalization of your ears and how to perform it. Tips, tricks, exercises, and techniques, you will learn all there is to know about equalization at a beginner level.
<br><br>

The basic physiology is one of the most important things to understand in order to dive safe and use your full potential. You will learn how the body adapts to this challenging environment and how your skills develop with your body.
<br><br>

What do we have in common with marine mammals? What happens with oxygen, what role plays carbon dioxide, how exactly do we need to breathe, how do we practice it and how much is too much? So many questions that you will finally get answers to. You also need to learn how to minimize energy use and become efficient while holding your breath. For this we introduce mental skills helping you to achieve deeper relaxation and visualization to help prepare and execute dives perfectly.
<br><br>

Safety is imperative, and a big part of the course is learning how to dive with a buddy, perform rescue procedures and prevent potential injuries. With proper knowledge and training, freediving is a very safe activity. To make it safer and more comfortable, you will learn about specific freedive gear and how to use it properly, how to train and progress.
<br><br>

You also get to connect with a worldwide community through our freediving platform where you can exchange experiences, training plans, challenge yourself and learn from the best in the world.
<br><br>

Freediving is a lifelong learning experience and yours starts here with Molchanovs.
